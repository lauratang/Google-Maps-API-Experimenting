# Google-Maps-API-Experimenting
Fun with maps

# Progress
1. first-map.html: add a map to a blank page
2. full-map.html: full screen map
3. visualizing-earthquakes.html: displays one set of data for earthquakes pulled from geojsonp
4. visualizing-earthquakes-multioption.html: displays two sets of data for earthquakes pulled from geojsonp
5. visualizing-recycling-bins.html: displays all the recycling bins on Staten Island (practiced getting data from other sources, turning into csv and then using a converting tool to change to geojsonp for processing)
6. using search/places api [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-simple]
6. geolocation (test online): where are you
7. geometry layer: draw shape around staten island
8. places api distance from where you are to closest recycling bin

9! information over time using a slider
10.

# Upsell Plans
1. Display data over a week period using a slider, using the circles, to show amount of upsells per area
2. Sort by Premium/SVOD/etc with refreshes (still can't figure it out for earthquake 4)
3. Sort by Northeast/Central/West and Zoom in on the area when selected
3. Autoplay?
